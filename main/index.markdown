# Billionaire counts with industries over years
{% include_relative _includes/industries.html %}

In terms of industries, both the **Energy** and **Media & Entertainment** sectors have shown minimal variations in billionaire counts over the past 14 years, indicating that wealth in these fields remains concentrated among specific individuals, suggesting limited liquidity within these sectors. 

The substantial increase in the number of billionaires in the Finance & Investments, Manufacturing, and Technology industries, with Manufacturing and Technology doubling their counts, reflects significant growth in these sectors.

However, the decline in billionaire counts across most industries since 2020 suggests a potential economic slowdown. This decline could be attributed to increased global economic uncertainty, supply chain issues, and a decrease in consumer confidence, affecting various sectors differently.

# All billionaires in top10 industries

The analysis highlights significant age disparities among billionaires across different countries. 

In the United States, the age range spans from 21 to 101 years old, making it the country with the widest age range among billionaires. In Russia, billionaires' ages range from 24 to 68, indicating a relatively narrower age range.

Indian billionaires tend to be around 60 years old, suggesting a concentration of wealth in this age group. German billionaires, on the other hand, show a diverse age distribution, with a notable concentration of wealth among individuals over 60, although no linear relationship is observed. 

# Top10%, top10%-20%, bottom80% average wealth of the year
{% include_relative _includes/average.html %}
The analysis demonstrates a significant disparity in wealth between the top 10% of billionaires and those in the 10%-20% bracket. From 2010, the average wealth of the top 10% of billionaires was twice that of the 10%-20% bracket, increasing to three times by 2023. 

This widening wealth gap between the wealthiest individuals and those moderately wealthy highlights a growing inequality trend over the years, indicating that the richest billionaires are amassing wealth at a much faster rate than the rest.

# Gap counts between female and male billionaires

The gender disparity among billionaires is substantial, both in terms of quantity and proportion. Among the top industries with the highest cumulative wealth, the food & beverage sector has the highest number of female billionaires, while the energy sector has the fewest. 

Additionally, in the finance & investment industry, the number of male billionaires significantly outweighs that of female billionaires. These observations underline the pronounced gender gap in billionaire representation across various industries, with notable differences in both numbers and proportions.
